# Behavior-IDS
This project is an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) based on Machine Learning, namely and mostly, Deep Learning using Python.

## Our goal
Our goal is to project an IDS capable enough of detecting attacks based on their(s) behavior(s) using neural networks CNN and LSTM.

## Requirements
In order to "run" our project it is necessary to have some unique dependencies:

```bash
pip install sklearn
pip install tensorflow
pip install jupyter
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

## Getting Started
Clone this repo somewhere
Install the dependencies trough your IDE
Run jupyter notebook --> For example:

```bash
C:\Users\Your_User\PycharmProjects\behavior-IDS>jupyter notebook
```

Run one of the models given and try for yourself

### Dowloading the Dataset
In case u wanna try and download the dataset yourself, here is the URL:
